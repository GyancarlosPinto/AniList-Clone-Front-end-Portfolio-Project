                    <h3>c. Reporting Violations:</h3>

                    Otaku
                    Realms takes such reports seriously and will investigate and take appropriate action in response to
                    confirmed violations.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>d. Consequences of Violation:</h3>

                    <h3>a. Responsibility for Confidentiality:</h3>
                    Users are solely responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of their account information, which
                    includes usernames and passwords. This information is personal and should not be shared or disclosed
                    to
                    any
                    third party. Users are advised to choose strong, unique passwords and to regularly update them to
                    enhance
                    the security of their accounts.

                    <h3>b. Unauthorized Use and Security Breach:</h3>
                    <h4>i. Prompt Notification:</h4>
                    In the event of any unauthorized use of their account or the discovery of a security breach, users
                    must
                    promptly notify Otaku Realms. Timely reporting is crucial to mitigating potential risks and
                    preventing
                    further unauthorized access.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>ii. Notification Process: </h4>
                    Users can report unauthorized access or security breaches by contacting Otaku Realms through the
                    designated
                    support channels. Providing detailed information about the incident will aid in the swift resolution
                    of
                    the
                    matter.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h4>iii. Cooperation with Otaku Realms: </h4>
                    Users agree to cooperate with Otaku Realms in any investigation related to unauthorized account
                    access
                    or
                    security breaches. This may include providing additional information, as requested, to verify
                    identity
                    or
                    assist in resolving the issue.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                    <h3>c. Security Best Practices:</h3>
                    <h4>i. Secure Devices:</h4>
                    Users are encouraged to access Otaku Realms from secure and trusted devices. Avoid using public
                    computers or
                    shared devices to log in to your account, especially in environments where the security of your
                    information
                    cannot be guaranteed.
                    </p>
                    <h4>ii. Logout After Use: </h4>
                    It is recommended that users log out of their accounts after each session, especially when using
                    shared
                    devices. This practice helps prevent unauthorized access in case the device is used by others.
                    <p>
                    </p>
                    <h4>iii. Password Management:</h4>
                    Regularly updating passwords and using unique combinations of letters, numbers, and symbols adds an
                    extra
                    layer of security to user accounts. Using the same password across multiple platforms increases
                    vulnerability, so diversification is advised.
                    <p>
                    <h3>d. Otaku Realms' Commitment to Security:</h3>
                    Otaku Realms is committed to implementing reasonable security measures to protect user accounts and
                    information. This includes encryption protocols, secure data storage practices, and continuous
                    monitoring
                    for potential security threats.

                    unforeseen
